      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/unnamed.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Jason Eckhart">

      <p>Jason Eckhart is a 29 year-old Kansas City resident. Born in Danbury, Connecticut, Jason moved with his family to KC when he was five years old.
        He graduated High School in 2007 from Blue Valley Northwest High School. With a passion for writing, and a keen sense of self expression through it,
        he decided to do what was "normal" and attend a university. After attempting a year at Kansas State University,Jason determined he was not cut out for the standard form of education.</p>

      <p> While Jason always struggled in school, he had a certain knack for using and maintaining desktop computers. This hobby, which
        started from simply playing video games and being exposed to the technology, blossmed into a passion. After the failed stint at college,
        Jason tried his hands at several things. Working operations at Guitar Center led to playing in a band, which led to going on tour. After
        which he fell in to a cooking job that continues to last for nearly a decade.</p>

      <p>Getting bored with life and frustrated with the service indursty, Jason began looking for something new. That is when
        he saw an add on reddit for a web design course at KU. A combination of frustration at his job, the hunger of knowledge,
        and the dissatisifaction of his past school performance motivated him to turn a new page and enroll. While he finds the pace
        of the course challenging, he is enjoying it immensly. While the work is hard, it is rewarding and hardly feels like the work
        he is used to.</p>
